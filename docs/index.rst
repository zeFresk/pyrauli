Welcome to pyrauli's documentation!
===================================

**pyrauli** is a high-performance Python package for quantum circuit simulation,
powered by the C++ `ProPauli`_ library.
It uses Pauli back-propagation to
efficiently calculate the expectation values of observables.

This documentation is structured to help you succeed, whether you are learning
the library for the first time or need a specific technical detail.
